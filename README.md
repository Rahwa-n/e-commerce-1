GIT WORKFLOW

In our workflow, we have two branches that always exist, master and development.

Master represents the most stable version of our project and it is used only for deployment for production.

NEVER PUSH TO MASTER!

Development is the branch we all are working on BY DEFAULT. It contains changes that are in progress and may not necessarily be ready for production.
